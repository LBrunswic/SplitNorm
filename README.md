## Implementation of Flows

### Flow Constructors
Elementary NF are obtained by composing simple operations. Lifted normalization
via convolutional flows generalizes this to a channel space distributional parameterization.
The simplest instance is an Ensemble of NF (a finite family of $p$ flows, the channeller outputs a distribution hence a softmax weighting of the flows:
  $$ C(x) = \sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_{i} \delta_{c_i}, \quad \alpha ) \mathrm{softmax}(NN(x))$$


The constructions allow to
- [x] Ensemble of NF
- [x] Convolution of Flows (channeller,commander,kernel)

The goal is to have building blocks for flows
